Comparison between OCD and Implementation.

1. OCD mentions the use of a test executive to demonstrate that the requirements have
   been met. The same functionality is achieved by the individual startup projects.
2. Files are uploaded and downloaded using a file streaming service. This type of streaming
   service has not been covered in the ocd.
3. The WPF client has been enhanced to control more operations of the client.
